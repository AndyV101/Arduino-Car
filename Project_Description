This description is for a Arduino controlled car. In this project you learn how to use:
- DC Motors
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- H Bridges
- Defining Variables
- Using maps
By looking at the code in the document "Arduino Car" there is the information and tutorial behind the 
maps, PinMode and defining variables. When defining varibles
