This description is for a Arduino controlled car. In this project you learn how to use:
- DC Motors
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- H Bridges
- Using maps
By looking at the code in the document "Arduino Car" there is the information and tutorial behind the 
maps, PinMode and defining variables. 

In the Arduino Car you use the DC Motor as the power to the wheels. DC Motors have no polarity. Which means that if you 
swap the wires on the motor it reverses the direction of the motors. The most common use for DC Motors is for a wheel of a car 
but you could also use it for a makeshift fan or DIY blender.


A H Bridge controller in this circuit is used to power the motor and control whether it is going forward or reverse. As seen
below the H Bridge controller has 4 switches. When switch 1 and switch 4 are closed the motor spins in one direction. When 
you close switch 2 and switch 3 the motor spins in the other direction.

Above is an example of what the H Bridge used on the Arduino Car looks like and what each pin does.

Pin 1 is the enable for Output 1 and 2. This is used so that when the motor is connected to power it is on and when it is 
connected to the ground it is off. 

Pins 2,7,10 and 15 determines what direction each motor will rotate in. Whether that is forward, reverse or stopped. Pin 2 and 7
control the direction of the left motor and Pin 10 and 15 controls the direction of the right motor. 

Pins 3 and 6 are the spots where the left motor connects to the H Bridge.
Pin 11 and 14 is where the right motor connects to the H Bridge. 

Pins 4, 5, 12 and 13 are the grounding pins. 

Pins 8 and 16 are the power supply pins

Pin 9 is the enable for the Output 3 and 4. This is used so that when the motor is connected to power it is on and when it is 
connected to the ground it is off. 

Pins 11 and 14 is where the right motor gets connected to the H Bridge. 


An Ultrasonic Sensor produces a very high pitch sound that we cannot hear. The sound then travels and bounces off an object
and back to sensor. The amount of time it takes for it to get back to the sensor and the speed of the sound you can get the 
distance between the objects. 

The Ultrasonic Sensor has 4 pins. 1 pin is the ground, 1 is the power. There is also a trigger pin and echo pin. The sound is 
released from the trigger pin and once it bounces off the object it goes back into the echo pin. 

In the Arduino Car you use Ultrasonic Sensors to control the speed of the DC Motor. The car has two Ultrasonic Sensors. One 
controls the speed of the left motors and one controls the speed of the right motor.  The closer an object comes to the sensor
the slower the motor rotates.
