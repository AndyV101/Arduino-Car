This description is for a Arduino controlled car. In this project you learn how to use:
- DC Motors
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- H Bridges
- Using maps
By looking at the code in the document "Arduino Car" there is the information and tutorial behind the 
maps, PinMode and defining variables. 

In the Arduino Car you use the DC Motor as the power to the wheels. DC Motors have no polarity. Which means that if you 
swap the wires on the motor it reverses the direction of the motors. The most common use for DC Motors is for a wheel of a car 
but you could also use it for a makeshift fan or DIY blender.

Below is an example of the pins on a H Bridge
1. Enable 1       16. Power
2. Input 1        15. Input 4
3. Output 1       14. Output 4
4. Ground         13. Ground
5. Ground         12. Ground
6. Output 2       11. Output 3
7. Input 2        10. Input 3
8. Power          9. Enable 2
